//heap
//cbt=(2^k)-1(max)
//2
//let n be the max node, k level of cbt
//k=2^(k-1)(min)
//at given cbt at each node, root node & max node are equal ,min heap & max heap need not to be equal
//mean heapify n max heapify
//every tree is graph but vica versa not true
//  o(log n)-> (worst & avg) n o(1)->best case
